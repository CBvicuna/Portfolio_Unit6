        My name is Carla Vicuna. I was born on July 19,2001 in Ecuador. I have 2 siblings, one sister and one brother, both older than me 
        My mom and dad are both from acuador, but we've lived here for many years, since before i was born. In fact we've always lived in queens.
        My favorite food in spagheti and my favorite color is red. I have a dog named princess and she loves to play.
        I like to write about dark, shady stories.They arent perfectly written but I write them for fun.

    My future career is to follow criminology and psychology. I want to either work in the FBI or help others as a psychologist. I like getting into people's minds and interpreting what they are thinking and having difficulty with. These are my two dream careers.
